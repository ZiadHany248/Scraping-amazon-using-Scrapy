# Scraping-amazon-using-scrapy

**Description:** This project is a webscraper that utilizes Scrapy to scrap pages from amazon. The keyword I used to search the pages of amazon was "Playstation". 
The scraper went through the first 150 pages of amazon and returned The Image link, price and name of each. 
The code for the scraper itself can be found [Contribution guidelines for this project](Scrapy_generated_folder/Scrapy_folder/spiders/scraper.py)
